# Fake News Detection System using LSTM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Fake News Detection System** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** deep learning model.  
The system classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake** based on textual content.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The rapid spread of fake news on digital platforms can mislead people and cause serious social and political issues.  
Manual verification of news is time-consuming, so this project aims to automate fake news detection using deep learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
- Text data is preprocessed using NLP techniques
- Tokenization and padding are applied to convert text into numerical form
- An LSTM neural network is trained to learn sequential text patterns
- The model predicts whether a given news article is real or fake
